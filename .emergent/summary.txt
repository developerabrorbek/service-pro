<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a professional website for a service company named Servis Pro.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Core Pages:** Homepage, multiple SEO-optimized service pages, and detailed pages for each equipment brand handled (e.g., Baxi, Navien, Ferroli).
- **Key Features:**
    - A premium, image-rich services section.
    - A brand carousel under the navbar, with each brand linking to its dedicated page.
    - Fully detailed brand pages with sections for brand overview, common problems, services, pricing, FAQ, and image gallery.
    - A contact form with Telegram integration (initially mocked).
- **Design:** A professional corporate dark theme (dark blue/gray), avoiding bright neon colors. The design must be premium, trustworthy, and visually dense with real service photos.
- **Languages:** The site must fully support three languages: Russian (RU - default), Uzbek Latin (UZ), and Uzbek Cyrillic (УЗ), managed via a language switcher in the navbar.
- **Responsiveness (CRITICAL):** The layout must be perfectly responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop), with a **mobile-first** approach. This has been a recurring critical issue.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in English. However, the application content must be multilingual (Russian, Uzbek Latin, Uzbek Cyrillic), so the next agent must handle and respond to requests considering this trilingual requirement.

**what currently exists?**
A frontend-only React application has been developed. It includes a Homepage, a generic Service Page, and a dynamic Brand Page component. The application architecture supports multi-language functionality via React Context and a large  file, which acts as a database, holding all text content, translations, and image URLs for services and brands. A complete, detailed page for the BAXI brand has been created as a template. Multiple iterations have been made to fix responsive design, but mobile UX remains a critical issue.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in the middle of a critical mobile-first refactor, mandated by the user due to unacceptable mobile UX. The agent first refactored  and its associated CSS in  to create a compact, mobile-friendly navbar. The last action was starting to update the hero section CSS to make it mobile-first by limiting its height and adding a text overlay.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool. The user has mandated visual verification on specific mobile viewports (320px, 360px, 375px, 414px) after the fix.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** Critical Mobile UX Failure (P0)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Description:** The current mobile layout is considered a production-blocking failure. The navbar is too tall, the hero section image dominates the screen pushing content below the fold, and the overall design lacks a mobile-first approach, resulting in a poor user experience.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent began a mobile-first refactor, starting with the  component and its corresponding CSS to create a compact mobile header. It then started working on the hero section CSS.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Complete the mobile-first refactor of the Hero section CSS in , ensuring the image height is limited (35-45vh) and CTAs are visible without scrolling.
        2.  Refactor the Services section CSS to ensure cards are full-width in a single column on mobile, with the image on top and text below.
        3.  Globally review and enforce , , and  for all images on mobile to prevent overflow and distortion.
        4.  Refactor all other pages and components (, , , etc.) to adhere to mobile-first principles.
        5.  Verify that the hamburger menu correctly contains the language switcher and navigation links, and that switching to Uzbek Cyrillic (УЗ) does not break the layout.
        6.  Test the entire application using the screenshot tool on viewports: 320px, 360px, 375px, and 414px.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Fixing this is the user's absolute priority. A successful fix will result in a professional, conversion-focused mobile experience, making the website production-ready.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Complete Mobile-First Refactor (P0)
    -   **Where to resume:** Continue the mobile-first CSS refactor in , starting with the hero section styles as per the user's latest instructions.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A fully responsive, clean, and professional mobile UI that addresses all of the user's critical feedback and is ready for production.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P1: Generate Content for All Brand Pages:** Use the completed BAXI page as a template to generate real, detailed, brand-specific content in all three languages (RU, UZ, УЗ) for all other brands listed in .
    -   **P2: Implement Backend for Telegram Integration:** Create a backend endpoint to handle submissions from the contact form and forward the data to the user's specified Telegram channel. This will require removing the current mock implementation.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   Develop and integrate Blog, News, and Our Work (portfolio) sections.
    -   Perform comprehensive SEO optimization for all pages, including unique meta titles and descriptions.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Recently completed:**
    -   Frontend scaffolding with Homepage, Service Page, and Brand Pages created.
    -   Implementation of a trilingual (RU, UZ, УЗ) system using React Context.
    -   Creation of a detailed, data-rich  file to serve as a mock database.
    -   Design of a premium services section and a clickable brand carousel.
    -   Development of a fully detailed, multilingual brand page for BAXI to serve as a template.
    -   Multiple iterations on responsive CSS for desktop and tablet layouts.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. All user-reported issues have been addressed or are currently in progress. The main challenge has been the recurring nature of the responsive layout issue.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   Not applicable.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router DOM, React Hooks (useContext, useState, useEffect).
-   **Styling:** Custom CSS in  using Flexbox and Grid. A **mobile-first** responsive design strategy is now a strict requirement.
-   **State Management:** React Context API is used for managing the global language state.
-   **Data:** All application content, including text and multilingual translations, is currently hardcoded in .
-   **Backend:** A boilerplate FastAPI server exists but is not yet integrated with the frontend.

**key DB schema**
-   No database is currently in use.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The primary stylesheet for the entire application. It is currently undergoing a major, mobile-first refactor.
-   : The central source of all content and translations. This file is edited to change any text on the site.
-   : The navigation component. Its structure and styling were recently changed to support the mobile-first design.
-   : The main landing page, which contains most of the components being refactored.
-   : The template for displaying detailed brand information. Its responsive layout must also be verified.
-   : Manages the language state (RU, UZ, УЗ) for the entire application.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The entire application's CSS and component structure must be refactored using a strict **mobile-first methodology** to resolve the critical responsive layout issues.
-   The massive  file should eventually be replaced with a proper backend API and database to improve maintainability and performance.

**key api endpoints**
-   None are actively used by the frontend. The application is frontend-only with mock data.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **MOBILE IS THE #1 PRIORITY:** Your immediate and sole focus must be to fix the mobile user experience. Follow the user's mobile-first instructions precisely. Do not start any other task until the mobile layout is perfect on all specified viewports (320px, 360px, 375px, 414px).
-   **Test Language Switching on Mobile:** A key failure point is the layout breaking when switching to Uzbek Cyrillic (УЗ) due to longer text. Ensure your mobile navbar and other components gracefully handle text length changes.
-   **Data is Mocked:** All content, including translations, is in . The backend exists but is not connected. The Telegram integration is a placeholder.
-   **Recurring Issue:** Responsiveness has been a persistent problem. Previous attempts failed. A complete, ground-up, mobile-first review is required, not just incremental patches.

    -   The Telegram integration for the contact form is a placeholder.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** Mobile responsiveness. Initial implementations have repeatedly failed to meet user standards, requiring multiple rounds of fixes.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent has consistently failed to deliver a truly mobile-first and robustly responsive design, despite multiple user requests and claims of completion. It has treated responsiveness as an afterthought rather than a core principle, leading to the current critical state. The next agent must not repeat this mistake and must prioritize the mobile-first refactor above all else.</analysis>
